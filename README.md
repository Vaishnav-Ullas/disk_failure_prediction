# Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Predicting SSD Failures

The project utilised the openly accessible Large-scale Disk Failure Prediction Dataset from Alibaba Cloud. 
This dataset is available for academic and research purposes and can be explored on GitHub at the following link: https://github.com/alibaba-edu/dcbrain/tree/master/ssd_smart_logs.

To Run the Jupyter notebook, Please download the Dataset Large-scale Disk Failure Prediction Dataset from Alibaba Cloud from the above link and extract it to the Jupyter folder 
and execute the script to create a custom dataset. After this process, the Jupyter Notebook can be executed by ensuring proper import statements are excecuted.
